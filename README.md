# Raw Data and Plot Scripts for Manuscript

This repository contains the raw data and plotting scripts for the figures in the following manuscript:

**Varghese, N. K., Mkrtchian, E., Singh, A., Savio, L., Boccia, M., Marzocchi, V., & Comite, A. (2024). NiFe on CeO2, TiO2 and ZrO2 Supports as Efficient Oxygen Evolution Reaction Catalysts in Alkaline Media. ChemRxiv. 2024; doi:10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-hsldj-v2**

Each folder corresponds to a specific figure in the paper, with the folder name matching the figure number/details. Inside each folder, you will find the raw data files and the Python scripts used to generate the plots for that figure.

The **XPS plots** were generated using a commercial software. The folder `fig_3_and_si_xps` contains only the raw XPS data.
